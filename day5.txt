Child to Parent Communication
	-- Sending data/control from child to parent
	-- @Output decorator
	-- Events and Event listeners
	-- Event; event handler; trigger the event
	-- Type of data which is to be sent to the parent
	-- ()

In the child component
1. Add an @Output decorator to be of type EventEmitter data type and also added the type of data which will be sent to the data
2. Initialise the @output property
3. In the required function, emitted the event by calling the emit method and passing the data as a parameter

In the parent component:
1. As part of the child tag, do the event binding and add the eventhandler 
2. In the parent component.ts add the definition of the event handler as part of component class


Lifecycle method:
-- Method will be called implicitly
-- Cannot be called explicitly
-- Called based on its position in lifecycle
-- Called once / multiple based on lifecycle method
-- Mounting phase, unmounting phase, updating phase
-- Mounting phase, unmounting phase -- called only once 
-- Updating phase -- can be called multiple times 
-- Implement an interface ; overriding the methods in the interface
-- 
Mounting of component:
1. constructor
2. ngOnChanges

Unmounting phase of component:
1. ngOnDestroy

ngOnchanges:
	--Interface: OnChanges
	--Method to be overridden
	ngOnChanges(simpleChanges:SimpleChanges):void
	{
	// simpleChanges has 3 values : firstChange:boolean, previousValue and currentValue
	// functionality to be performed when the bound property changes
	// functionality to be performed whenever the input elements changes
	}
	-- can be called multiple times
	-- First time will be called after the constructor during the mounting of the component
	-- Will be surely called atleast once during the mounting phase

ngOnInit 
	-- Will be called only once during the entire lifecycle of component
	-- Used for initialisations
	-- Transforming/changing the data coming from the parent
	-- Work with a timer
	-- Subscribe to 3rd party api's



Parent, ChildP
Parent --> Child :Property binding : usrArr:
In child display-- users who have a salary > 10000
Transform:
	-- Pure function
constructor : usrArr -- not accessible
ngOnInit : filtering of usrArr: Yes
